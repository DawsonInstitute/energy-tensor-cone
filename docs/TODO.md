# TODO.md: Next Steps for warp-cone-aqei Project

**All initial tasks completed!** See `TODO-completed.md` for details.

The repository is fully functional with:
- Complete directory structure and build system
- Working Lean 4 formalization with Mathlib integration
- Mathematica randomized search pipeline
- Python orchestration and Lean code generation
- Full test suite passing (`./run_tests.sh`)
- Advanced formal proofs beyond initial scope

For future work, consider:
- Scaling Mathematica trials for more computational exploration
- Proving additional lemmas in Lean (e.g., characterizing extreme rays)
- Connecting the finite-dimensional coefficient model to full stress-energy tensors
- Exploring specific AQEI bounds from QFT literature
