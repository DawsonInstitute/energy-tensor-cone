# TODO.md: Next Steps for energy-tensor-cone Project

This document tracks remaining tasks for the energy-tensor-cone project.

**All core tasks (Steps 1-6) completed as of February 6, 2026.**

See `TODO-completed.md` for completed tasks.

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

These are stretch goals beyond the initial scope:

- Scale Mathematica searches to 1e6 trials for more thorough exploration
- Generate and include histogram plots in the paper (requires running Python analysis)
- Compile draft.tex to PDF and perform final formatting review
- Prove additional infinite constraint lemmas in Lean
- Extend formalization to 3+1 dimensional spacetimes
- Submit preprint to arXiv
- Target journal submission: Journal of Mathematical Physics
