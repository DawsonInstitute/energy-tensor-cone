**Project Goal**: Submit a high-quality paper on the convex cone of stress-energy tensors satisfying AQEI, combining Lean formalization, computational searches, and verification against known bounds.

**Current Status (February 12, 2026)**: Repo at https://github.com/DawsonInstitute/energy-tensor-cone. Anonymized repo at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/aqei-convex-cone-5789/. Zenodo restricted. CQG desk rejection received (ref: CQG-115023) due to insufficient standards in scientific reporting/references. Shift to revision and resubmission.

### Active Tasks

**1. Additional Verification & Polish (Active)**
- Add explicit analytic bound comparisons (e.g., Fewster-style worldline bounds) to the paper.
- Connect comparisons to the existing computational outputs and verified vertex.
- Commit: "Enhance verification section with bound comparisons"

### Pre-Submission Checklist (PRD)
- PRD PDF builds cleanly.
- Submit to PRD (parallel arXiv if desired).
- Update project READMEs/sites with PRD status post-submission.

### Archived Planning Material

- Literature-expansion notes and reference-candidate lists moved to docs/TODO-backlog.md.
